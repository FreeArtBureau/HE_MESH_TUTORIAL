Install library controlP5


Move folder controlP5 into Processing's libraries folder and restart Processing.


How?

Contributed libraries must be downloaded separately and placed within 
the "libraries" folder of your Processing sketchbook. To find the Processing 
sketchbook location on your computer, open the Preferences window from the 
Processing application and look for the "Sketchbook location" item at the top. 

Copy the contributed library's folder into the "libraries" folder at this location. 
You will need to create the "libraries" folder if this is your first contributed library. 

By default the following locations are used for your sketchbook folder.
For mac users the sketchbook folder is located inside ~/Documents/Processing. 
for windows users the sketchbook folder is located inside folder 'My Documents'/Processing
